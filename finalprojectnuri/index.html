      <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) plays a pivotal role in ensuring the safety and compliance of products entering the market. In this analysis, we dive into the data of FDA warnings posted in 2018-2022. </p>

      <<<iframe title="Top 3 Consistent Warning Genres" aria-label="Pie Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-TAZeC" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/TAZeC/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="625" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();

</script>;


      <p>The most persistent challenges that producers tend to grapple with, seem to be tobacco and e-cigarette warnings. There are almost 4 times the average amount of alerts. In all, there were 645 about pharmaceuticals, 361 regarding suppliers, 282 about food, 227 involving COVID-19, and 141 about manufacturing mistakes. In contrast to a noteworthy 1103 warnings related to smoking. The sum of the four years is represented by these totals. </p>

      <p>Former FDA reviewer, Kendra, explained that the FDA has a risk based approach to the alerts, prioritizing the ones with the most risk to potential consumers. Tobacco and vape products can cause major respiratory and long-term risk especially because it is mostly used by the youth.  Elaborating on the risk based approach: The FDA searches for items that have not gotten its full authorization or do not meet an exception to FDA approval. She emphasizes how difficult it would be to pinpoint one overall reason for why there are so many tobacco warnings because it was a case by case and center by center type of thing, especially during Covid-19 when so many new products started emerging in the market. As the minor use of vaping goods continues to climb, public awareness raises. Premarket authorization orders of vaping goods seem to be one of the primary violations in the data notes. The FDA must receive a report from the manufacturer, and the agency must then issue an order finding the product to be substantially accurate to a predicate tobacco/vape product. If not then manufacturer must then provide a report attesting to the fact that all modifications are completed. </p>

      <p>Examining the smoking cases, I also noticed a consistent climb until 2020, followed by a sharp surge in 2021, and a gradual decline in 2022. According to the Food and Drug Law Institute website, which has a certified .org website tag. There was a substantial backlog in both foreign and domestic surveillance inspections in 2020. The FDA temporarily halted all routine inspections of domestic and overseas surveillance facilities after COVID-19 started to spread in the United States in March 2020, but it was still able to carry out "mission critical" inspections when necessary. The agency struggled to resume the number of inspections it had prior to Covid. However, once they got things up and running in late July 2020, they aimed to go back and issue the delayed warnings. </p>

      <p>Before this analysis, I predicted that the warnings may be because of the chemical makeup of the vape or tobacco, but most were issused because many companies were not getting the preapproval of the FDA. According to a “New Truth Initiative” study published in Tobacco Control, the majority of warning letters the Food and Drug Administration sent to e-cigarette companies between 2020 and 2021 covered e-cigarette brands with market entry, and very few addressed the e-cigarette product types. The FDA 2021 Year in Review paper states that... “We pledged to advance two regulations in 2021 that will fundamentally alter the environment. Two specific suggested product standards—one banning menthol in cigarettes and the other banning all distinctive flavors—including menthol in cigars. It will be possible to save lives by outlawing flavors in cigars and menthol, the remaining permitted taste in cigarettes, especially for the people who are disproportionately impacted by these harmful items.”  This statement shows you that the FDA truly prioritizes the safety of youth, which explains the strong focus on vape producers. The FDA also had contracts for tobacco shop compliance check inspections in about 56 states and territories as of November 30, 2021. These new proposed standards could also be a factor in the tremendous increase in warnings in 2021. </p>

      <p>Furthermore, in a press release from the FDA on January 27, 2021, the administration reflected on 2020 and stated that they are looking forward to the new year as they put new procedures in place. “With most OPDP staff and stakeholders working at home, we have modified how we accept materials.” The FDA changed the review process which may have been another result of the 2020-2021 spike in warnings. </p>

      <p>Thus, upon review, it became evident that tobacco and vaping products are a huge priority for the FDA. According to Kendra, a former FDA reviewer, the agency's risk-based strategy highlights its emphasis on potential harm to consumers. By analyzing the time trends, it is possible to determine that the COVID-19 pandemic backlog, the FDA's updated review procedures, and new regulations aimed at menthol and unique tastes are potential reasons for the 2021 warning spike. I must disclaim that there might be some factors not accounted for in the data: such as a lack of documentation. I hope that this study will help producers who fall within the FDA's jurisdiction, especially those in the e-cigarette and tobacco businesses. </p>
