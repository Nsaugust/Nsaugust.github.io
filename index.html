    <h1>Charlie Sheen reunites with 'Two and a Half Men' creator years after public meltdown</h1>
    <h2>Two and a Half Men' creator Chuck Lorre and Charlie Sheen had a public falling out in 2011, shortly before the actor was fired from the sitcom</h2>

    <p><strong>By Lauryn Overhultz Fox News</strong></p>
    <p>Chuck Lorre and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/charlie-sheens-reaction-daughter-samis-onlyfans-career-this-can-only-go-bad">Charlie Sheen</a> are back in action after a public meltdown led to the actor's firing from the hit show "Two and a Half Men".</p>
    <p>Sheen is starring in the TV writer's latest project, "Bookie." Lorre recalled the "humiliating" past and how his first table read with Sheen went after all these years.</p>
    <p>"Well, I think it's important to say first, for eight and a half years we had a terrific time," Lorre told "Entertainment Tonight." "We were friends, we worked together and we made a show we were proud of. We laughed a lot. It was a crazy, edgy, risqué show, and we took great pride in pushing the envelope."</p>
    <p>"And then it all went down in a very dark and difficult way," he continued. "It was really hurtful, it was humiliating, it was depressing, it was infuriating. It was all sorts of horrible things. For a long time I couldn't watch the show, I couldn't watch reruns, it was just too painful."</p>

    <p>Sheen publicly attacked Lorre in 2011 after the creator shut down production of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/two-and-a-half-men-celebrates-20th-anniversary-cast">"Two and a Half Men"</a> as the "Anger Management" star entered rehab. At the time, the actor wrote a letter to TMZ calling Lorre a "little maggot" and also referred to him as a "stupid, stupid man."</p>  


    <p>The public comments and an interview in which Sheen said he was "winning" and had "tiger blood" led to Sheen's firing from the show.</p>

    <p>Now, he's joined Lorre again to portray a fictional version of himself alongside comedian Sebastian Maniscalco, who plays a Los Angeles bookie.</p>

    <p>"I was hopeful that Charlie was in a good place and up for it," Lorre told the outlet. "I called his agent... they put me in touch with Charlie, and I said, 'Here's a funny idea.'"</p>
    <p>"He couldn't have been more gracious and enthusiastic and generous about the whole thing," he added. "We talked on the phone for probably an hour that first time, and I sent him the script – 'cause I'm asking him to play himself, a fictional version of himself, and I wanted to be respectful that it was something he'd be comfortable with."</p>

    <p>Sheen asked Lorre to change one part of the script, the TV writer told the outlet.</p>

   

    <p>"He said, 'Can we not do the drug addict Charlie?' and I went, 'Yeah, let's think about it and figure out another way for this to go,'" he said. Sheen's character ended up running a poker game at a rehab he had previously attended after getting sober.</p>
    <p>"It was a throwaway line where he says, 'That's a great rehab, I've been here many times,'" Lorre recalled. "I don't want to do anything hurtful. I thought he was doing us a huge favor by doing this to play himself. And if it was uncomfortable for him, I don't want him to be uncomfortable."</p>

    <p>For Lorre, the first table read with the actor was "closure" all these years after the "Two and a Half Men" drama and he believes it was the same for Sheen.</p>

    <p>"The first time I saw him [was] before the table read for the first episode, which is nerve-wracking to begin with," he shared. "It was just the most natural thing in the world. The two of us hugged... It was closure. It was healing. And it was a big weight off my heart."</p>

    <p>"And I don't want to speak for Charlie, but I think he felt the same thing," Lorre added. "It was a great opportunity for us to bury that darkness, and have fun."</p>

    <p>A representative for Sheen did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.</p>
